The following test module tries to test the behavior of a file system watchdog.
However the test module suffers from several problems

	* The test is too large
        * The test is testing too much (hard to know why it fails)
	* Bad naming
	* Side effects are tested together with pure functions
	* Unnecessary comments
	* Duplication

Your task is to refactor the test into something nice and maintainable.
